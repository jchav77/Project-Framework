# Analytics Project Framework {#analytics-project-framework}

**Version:** 2025-10-29  
**Why this exists:** To provide a complete, reusable methodology for analytics projects in financial services operations (auto finance, vendor management, risk analytics, process improvement).  
**Philosophy (5 principles):** front-load thinking; show WIP early; define “done”; validate data early; prefer actionable over perfect.

## Diagram — The 5 Phases {#diagram}
```
DISCOVER  →  DEFINE  →  DEVELOP  →  DELIVER  →  DOCUMENT
Week 1       Week 1–2    Week 2–4    Week 4–5    Week 5
```
**Success factors:** clear decision focus; weekly demos; solid metrics definitions; explicit validation; stakeholder engagement; disciplined change control.

---

## How to Use This Document {#how-to-use}
1. Start each project by cloning the folder structure and copying the charter template.  
2. During Week 1–2, finalize the metrics dictionary and mockup before heavy coding.  
3. In Weeks 2–4, iterate weekly, reconcile metrics, and track changes.  
4. In Week 4–5, polish, present, and capture decisions.  
5. In Week 5, document lessons and hand off.

---

## Phase 1: DISCOVER (Week 1) {#phase-1-discover}
**Why it matters:** Early clarity reduces rework. A 60–90 minute chartering effort often prevents days of rebuilding later.

### Activities
1) **Pre-kickoff research:** mine prior decks, dashboards, and audit notes.  
2) **Kickoff meeting:** use a tight agenda to align decisions, success criteria, scope, and timeline.  
3) **Project charter:** write a one-page charter and confirm via email the same day.

### Kickoff Agenda (60 min)
- Purpose, decision, due date  
- Background/context & prior attempts  
- Scope (in/out) & constraints (policy, data access)  
- Success criteria and key metrics  
- Timeline, next steps, owners

### Charter Template
- Business question; decision to inform; background and context  
- Scope (in/out); deliverable format; success criteria  
- Timeline; key metrics; data sources; open questions; next steps

### Discovery Checkpoint
- Charter emailed and acknowledged  
- Weekly demo on calendars  
- Risks and assumptions captured

---

## Phase 2: DEFINE (Week 1–2) {#phase-2-define}
**Why it matters:** Strong definitions and a mockup ensure we build the right thing.

### Activities
1) **Metrics Dictionary:** define business and technical formulas, sources, filters, and validation.  
2) **Deliverable Mockup:** align on output format and story before coding.  
3) **Validation Plan:** list checks (completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness) and sample SQL.

### Metrics Dictionary — Example
| Metric | Business Definition | Technical Formula | Source | Rules | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recovery Rate | Recovered $ / Charged-off $ over period | SUM(recovery_amount)/NULLIF(SUM(charge_off_amount),0) | recovery_mart | exclude reversals | reconcile to prod |

### Validation — Example SQL
```sql
-- Timeliness: recent data present within SLA
SELECT MAX(load_date) AS latest_load FROM recovery_mart;

-- Accuracy: sums reconcile with control totals
SELECT SUM(recovery_amount) FROM recovery_mart
WHERE recovery_date BETWEEN :start AND :end;

-- Uniqueness: primary key duplicates
SELECT account_id, recovery_date, COUNT(*) c
FROM recovery_mart
GROUP BY 1,2
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Define Checkpoint
- Metrics agreed and versioned  
- Mockup approved (explicit “yes”)  
- Validation log opened with owners

---

## Phase 3: DEVELOP (Week 2–4) {#phase-3-develop}
**Why it matters:** Iteration with weekly demos prevents surprises.

### Activities
1) **Weekly check-ins:** demo WIP; capture decisions; reconcile metrics.  
2) **Build with documentation:** docstrings/readme, modular code, small commits.  
3) **Quality assurance:** add spot checks and unit tests aligned to validation log.  
4) **Scope management:** when requests change, adjust plan or trade scope.

### Weekly Check-in — Agenda
- Headline progress (BLUF)  
- Demo of new increments  
- Risks/issues & decision requests  
- Next steps & dates

### Code Documentation — Template
```
/src
  |- __init__.py
  |- etl/
  |- features/
  |- models/
  |- utils/
/notebooks
/docs
/tests
README.md  ← how to run, inputs/outputs, assumptions
```

### Scope Change — Response Template
> “Thanks for the request. To include [new item], we’ll either extend the timeline by [X] or trade off [Y]. Which path would you prefer?”

### Develop Checkpoint
- Demos held; decisions logged  
- Code documented; tests passing  
- Scope changes approved and tracked

---

## Phase 4: DELIVER (Week 4–5) {#phase-4-deliver}
**Why it matters:** Clear storytelling (BLUF: bottom line up front) gets decisions made.

### Activities
1) **Polish the deliverable:** titles as takeaways, units/timeframes, footnotes, accessible contrast.  
2) **Story structure:** executive summary, then evidence, then implications and decision.  
3) **Presentation preparation:** timebox Q&A; anticipate tough questions; rehearse.  
4) **Feedback & follow-up:** capture action items with owners and dates.

### Executive Summary — Pattern
- Takeaway headline  
- Three bullets: what, so-what, now-what  
- Decisions requested with owners/dates

### Deliver Checkpoint
- Decision recorded  
- Action items assigned  
- Follow-up cadence set

---

## Phase 5: DOCUMENT (Week 5) {#phase-5-document}
**Why it matters:** Documentation reduces risk and speeds future work.

### Activities
1) **Lessons learned:** short retro capturing keep/stop/start items.  
2) **Code & analysis docs:** update README, metric definitions, and pipelines.  
3) **Runbook for recurring analysis:** inputs, steps, schedule, checks, contacts.  
4) **Knowledge transfer:** handoff meeting with artifacts list.

### Runbook — Template
- Purpose and scope  
- Inputs and sources (owners, refresh cadence)  
- Steps and scripts to run  
- Checks and thresholds  
- Outputs and recipients  
- Contacts and support

## Troubleshooting Guide {#troubleshooting}
Below are common scenarios with actions you can take now and steps to prevent recurrence.

### Unclear requirements {#unclear-requirements}
**Symptoms:** Stakeholders give conflicting needs; decisions not explicit.

**Fix now:**
- Re-run a 30-min charter session focused on the decision and due date
- Draft and circulate a one-page summary; get written confirmation
- Freeze scope until the decision and success criteria are confirmed

**Prevent next time:**
- Start every project with a charter
- Attach decision owners and timelines
- Keep a visible decision log


### Data quality issues mid-build {#data-quality-issues-mid-build}
**Symptoms:** Unexpected nulls, duplicates, or mismatched totals appear in Week 3.

**Fix now:**
- Open a DQ issue with owner/ETA
- Isolate affected metrics
- Add protective checks in code

**Prevent next time:**
- Run Day-3 validation by default
- Track DQ issues from the start
- Reconcile to control totals weekly


### Stakeholder not engaged {#stakeholder-not-engaged}
**Symptoms:** Reviews missed; feedback arrives too late.

**Fix now:**
- Shorten demos to 15 minutes
- Send BLUF recap and explicit asks
- Escalate early and factually

**Prevent next time:**
- Put weekly demos on calendar Day 1
- Use mockups to secure early buy-in
- Timebox decisions


### Scope creep without time change {#scope-creep-without-time-change}
**Symptoms:** New asks accumulate silently.

**Fix now:**
- Use the scope-change response template
- Offer explicit tradeoffs
- Document approvals

**Prevent next time:**
- Require decision on tradeoffs
- Track scope items publicly
- Review weekly


### Conflicting data sources {#conflicting-data-sources}
**Symptoms:** Two versions of the truth persist.

**Fix now:**
- Pick a primary source; document differences
- Add footnotes and links
- Create a migration plan

**Prevent next time:**
- Define metrics once
- Centralize lineage and owners
- Establish reconciliation cadence


### Running out of time {#running-out-of-time}
**Symptoms:** Deadline near; build unfinished.

**Fix now:**
- Cut scope to a minimal viable insight
- Defer nice-to-haves
- Schedule a follow-up release

**Prevent next time:**
- Lock MVP during Define phase
- Validate early
- Hold weekly decision checkpoints


### Analysis reveals nothing actionable {#analysis-reveals-nothing-actionable}
**Symptoms:** Findings are descriptive but not decision-driving.

**Fix now:**
- Reframe the decision
- Add benchmarks/thresholds
- Propose explicit options and implications

**Prevent next time:**
- Ask for the decision up front
- Define success metrics
- Use options & tradeoffs pattern


### Technical roadblocks {#technical-roadblocks}
**Symptoms:** Access or tooling slows progress.

**Fix now:**
- Escalate dependency; propose alternatives
- Parallelize sample calculations
- Document blockers

**Prevent next time:**
- List dependencies in charter
- Add backup paths
- Keep a short path to sample data


### Numbers diverge from production {#numbers-diverge-from-production}
**Symptoms:** Stakeholders lose trust.

**Fix now:**
- Open reconciliation task; identify rules/downstream logic
- Explain differences openly
- Agree on source of truth

**Prevent next time:**
- Version metric definitions
- Run periodic reconciliations
- Document deltas


### Team changes mid-project {#team-changes-mid-project}
**Symptoms:** New joiners lack context.

**Fix now:**
- Hold a 30-min handoff
- Share the README and decision log
- Assign a buddy

**Prevent next time:**
- Document as you go
- Keep the log current
- Maintain a simple runbook
