## Starting to Code on Day 1 {#starting-to-code-on-day-1}
**What Happens:** Detailed scenario where teams move fast without alignment, causing rework and trust loss.

**Why It’s Expensive:** Wasted build time, delayed decisions, credibility hit with leadership.

**Prevention:**
- [ ] Confirm decision, due date, and deliverable format.
- [ ] Create a metrics dictionary with formulas and sources.
- [ ] Show a mockup in Week 1; secure explicit approval.
- [ ] Open a validation log by Day 3 and reconcile to control totals.
- [ ] Hold weekly demos; maintain a decision log.

**Real Examples:**
- Vendor recovery rate analysis re-run because denominator differed from finance control totals.
- Operational risk dashboard delayed after late discovery of duplicate account rows.
- Process cycle time analysis rebuilt when stakeholders expected distribution percentiles, not averages.

## Detailed Pitfalls by Phase {#pitfalls-by-phase}

### Discovery
- Misaligned decisions; unclear owner → **Fix:** Re-charter with decision, owner, date.
- No calendar holds for demos → **Fix:** Schedule in kickoff.
- Missing constraints → **Fix:** Capture policy/data constraints explicitly.

### Define
- Ambiguous metrics → **Fix:** Single-source definitions with examples.
- Mockup skipped → **Fix:** Require visual sign-off before build.
- Validation plan absent → **Fix:** Day-3 checks minimum.

### Develop
- Scope drift untracked → **Fix:** Use tradeoffs template.
- No reconciliations → **Fix:** Weekly reconcile with production.
- Docs lag code → **Fix:** Update README in each increment.

### Deliver
- BLUF missing → **Fix:** Executive summary first.
- Footnotes absent → **Fix:** Add sources, refresh dates, definitions.
- No action capture → **Fix:** Owner/date for each decision.

### Document
- Lessons skipped → **Fix:** 30-min retro with keep/stop/start.
- Runbook missing → **Fix:** Provide steps, checks, contacts.
- Handoff shallow → **Fix:** Bundle artifacts and meet.

## Warning Signs Your Project Is At Risk {#warning-signs}
1. Day 1 and code starts without a charter.  
2. Week 2 and no stakeholder has seen anything.  
3. KPI totals don’t match finance control totals.  
4. New asks appear but timeline doesn’t move.  
5. Validation log is empty.  
6. “We’ll fix docs later.”  
7. Conflicting dashboards exist in parallel.  
8. No owner for open risks.  
9. Demos get canceled.  
10. “We found nothing actionable.”

## Recovery Strategies {#recovery}

### Wrong deliverable format (discovered Week 4) {#wrong-deliverable-format-discovered-week-4}
- Pause build; create a 1-page mockup of the expected output
- Align with sponsor; cut scope to minimum viable insight
- Schedule a follow-up release for deferred items

### Stakeholder disengaged (Week 2–3) {#stakeholder-disengaged-week-2-3}
- Shorten demo to 15 minutes with explicit asks
- Send a BLUF email with a decision needed
- Escalate respectfully with facts and options

### Major data quality issues (Week 3) {#major-data-quality-issues-week-3}
- Freeze scope; isolate affected metrics
- Open DQ issues with owners and ETAs
- Add guardrails and notes; communicate impact

### Running out of time (Week 3) {#running-out-of-time-week-3}
- Select MVP metrics only
- Defer nice-to-haves to a scheduled next release
- Rehearse a crisp exec summary

### Analysis reveals nothing interesting {#analysis-reveals-nothing-interesting}
- Revisit the decision framing
- Add thresholds/benchmarks to force a recommendation
- Provide 2–3 options with tradeoffs

---

## Success Stories: What Works {#success-stories}
1) Recovery-rate uplift review reached a decision in one meeting by leading with BLUF and mockup-approved visuals.  
2) Vendor scorecard stabilized when a single metrics dictionary and reconciliation cadence were adopted.  
3) Cycle-time improvements landed by pairing a minimal deliverable with a clear runbook and quick follow-up release.  
4) Risk dashboard trust increased after explicit footnotes and refresh dates were added.  
5) Weekly demos cut rework by surfacing surprises early.

---

## Final Lessons {#final-lessons}
**Golden Rules (10):** define “done”; align decisions; validate early; demo weekly; reconcile metrics; document as you go; track scope; capture actions; keep runbooks; run retros.  

**Common Themes:** rework is preventable; clarity beats cleverness; adoption matters more than elegance.  

**Most Important Lesson:** the best analysis is the one leaders *use* to decide.  

**Your Action Plan:** apply the Quick Start on the next project; keep a living decision log; schedule the week-5 retro now.
