# Quick Start Guide {#quick-start-guide}

**Goal:** Execute the first three days of any analytics project in a way that prevents rework, surfaces risks early, and aligns stakeholders.

---

## Day 1: Discovery & Kickoff (4–6 hours) {#day-1}

### Morning: Pre-Kickoff Preparation
**Step 1: Research the Context (45 min)**  
What to research: prior decks, dashboards, audit/compliance notes, historical metric definitions, prior vendor SLAs.  
Where to look: analytics repo, BI portal, risk/compliance share, PMO archives.  
Questions to prepare: who decides, what decision is due when, what is in/out of scope, what constraints exist (data access, policy).

**Step 2: Draft Initial Questions (30 min)**  
- Business context: target outcome, tradeoffs, constraints.  
- Current state: existing reports, known gaps, pain points.  
- Success criteria: metric move, decision date, acceptable error tolerance.  
- Scope boundary: what’s explicitly out.

**Step 3: Set Up Project Folder (15 min)**  
```
/01_discover
/02_define
/03_develop
/04_deliver
/05_document
README.md
```
**Step 4: Review Project Checklist (15 min)**  
Confirm charter, mockup plan, validation plan are understood.

### Afternoon: Kickoff Meeting & Charter Draft
**Step 5: Run the Kickoff (60 min)**  
Agenda: introductions; business question; decision needed; success criteria; scope; timeline; risks; next steps.  
Critical questions: what must be decided, by whom, by when; what would make this a “no-go”; whose time is critical.  
Note-taking: capture decisions and owners live; confirm recap at end.

**Step 6: Draft the Project Charter (90 min)**  
Use this template and email to sponsor the same day with a confirmation ask.
### Project Charter Template {#project-charter-template}
- **Business Question:** 
- **Decision to Inform:** 
- **Background & Context:** 
- **Scope (In/Out):** 
- **Deliverable Format (pptx, dashboard, memo):** 
- **Success Criteria (measurable):** 
- **Timeline & Milestones:** 
- **Key Metrics (definitions link):** 
- **Data Sources (owner, refresh cadence):** 
- **Open Questions:** 
- **Next Steps & Owners:**

> Email subject: “Charter — [Project Name] — Please review and confirm by [date]”

**End of Day 1 Checkpoint**
- Charter sent to sponsor
- Weekly demo time blocked
- Questions list captured

---

## Day 2: Requirements & Mockup (4–6 hours) {#day-2}

### Morning: Metrics Dictionary & Data Mapping
**Step 7: Create Metrics Dictionary (90 min)**  
Include business and technical definitions, data sources, rules, and validation.  
Examples of strong definitions: specific denominator, clear filters, refresh cadence.
### Metrics Dictionary Template {#metrics-dictionary-template}
| Metric | Business Definition | Technical Formula | Data Source | Filters/Rules | Validation Approach | Known Issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recovery Rate |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| DPD 30+ |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Charge-off Rate |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Step 8: Map Your Data Sources (60 min)**  
Draw simple lineage (source → staging → mart/report). Document owners and SLAs.

### Afternoon: Mock Up the Deliverable
**Step 9: Create Deliverable Mockup (90 min)**  
- PowerPoint: 1-page exec summary; 3 supporting pages (finding, evidence, implication).  
- Dashboard: wireframe with filters, KPIs, and drill path.  
- Excel: tabs for inputs, calc, outputs; clear footnotes.

**Step 10: Get Stakeholder Approval (60 min)**  
Walk through the mockup; ask for “what would make this fail” feedback. Capture sign-off.

**End of Day 2 Checkpoint**
- Metrics dictionary drafted
- Mockup approved or revised with comments
- Validation plan sketched

---

## Day 3: Data Validation & Planning (4–6 hours) {#day-3}

### Morning: Data Quality Checks
**Step 11: Pull Sample Data (30 min)**  
Start with a week or month of data across key tables.

**Step 12: Run Data Quality Checks (90 min)**  
Completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness. Log findings.
```sql
-- Sample pulls for Day 3 validation

-- Completeness: expect active accounts in both tables
SELECT a.account_id
FROM core_loan a
LEFT JOIN vendor_recovery b ON a.account_id = b.account_id
WHERE a.status = 'ACTIVE' AND b.account_id IS NULL;

-- Consistency: check date joins and currency fields
SELECT COUNT(*) AS bad_rows
FROM vendor_recovery
WHERE recovery_amount < 0 OR recovery_date < origination_date;

-- Uniqueness: duplicate keys
SELECT account_id, recovery_date, COUNT(*) 
FROM vendor_recovery
GROUP BY account_id, recovery_date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Step 13: Document Data Issues (30 min)**  
Open a data quality log with issue, owner, impact, and ETA to resolve.

### Afternoon: Build the Analysis Plan
**Step 14: Create Analysis Plan (90 min)**  
Outline phases, estimates, and demo schedule.

**Step 15: Set Up Version Control (30 min)**  
Create `/src`, `/notebooks`, `/docs`, `/tests`; add a project README.

**Step 16: Schedule Weekly Check-ins (15 min)**  
Send calendar holds with a standing agenda.

**End of Day 3 Checkpoint**
- Sample data pulled and checks run
- Risks logged with owners
- Analysis plan ready
- Weekly check-ins scheduled

**Critical Rule Throughout:** no complex coding until Day 4.

## What Good Looks Like {#what-good-looks-like}
- Sponsor replies “yes” to the charter recap with no major changes.  
- Mockup gets explicit approval.  
- Validation log captures findings and owners by Day 3.  
- Check-ins recur weekly with a clear decisions-needed list.

### Additional Tips

- Keep charters short and testable.
- Start small; expand after validation.
- Label all charts with units and timeframes.

## Additional SQL Snippets {#extra-sql}

-- Consistency across systems (example join rules)
SELECT a.account_id, a.balance_amt, b.balance_amt AS balance_bi
FROM core_loan a
JOIN bi_loan_snapshot b
  ON a.account_id = b.account_id AND b.as_of_date = CURRENT_DATE
WHERE ABS(a.balance_amt - b.balance_amt) > 0.01;

-- Timeliness SLA check (expect <= 48 hours lag)
SELECT DATE_PART('day', CURRENT_DATE - MAX(load_ts)) AS days_since_last_load
FROM vendor_recovery_load_audit;

-- Uniqueness across composite keys
SELECT account_id, vendor_id, period, COUNT(*) c
FROM vendor_scorecard
GROUP BY 1,2,3
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Self-Check Questions (End of Each Day) {#self-check}
- Is the decision and due date documented?
- Has a mockup been shown and approved (or revised with comments)?
- Do we have a validation log with owners and ETAs?
- Are weekly demos on the calendar with a standing agenda?
- Are risks visible with owners?

---

## Risks & Responses (Playbook) {#risks-playbook}
| Risk | Early Signal | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Stakeholder disengaged | Missed reviews | Shorten demos, send BLUF recap, escalate with options |
| Data gaps found | Nulls, mismatches | Log DQ issue, isolate impact, add guardrails |
| Conflicting metrics | Totals differ | Reconcile to control totals, document deltas |
| Scope drift | New asks accumulate | Offer tradeoffs, document approvals |
